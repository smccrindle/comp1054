// STEP 6: Nab all the SUMMARY elements


// STEP 7: Loop through the element array, and add an event listener for the toggle event

	
		// STEP 8a: Check to see whether the DETAILS event that was toggled has the "open" attribute
		
			// STEP 8b: The browser just added the "open" attribute, so this DETAILS element was previously closed
			
				// STEP 8c: If this DETAILS element is NOT the one that was just clicked, close it by removing the "open" attribute
